It is my hope to secure a position with a well-established corporation such as yours where I can build my career and become a valuable member of your team. 

I believe my experience and skills with Javascript, jQuery, Angular, Underscore, Node, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Jade and Stylus make me a good fit for your team. I learn quickly and can comfortably adapt to constantly changing technology.

I have the ability to solve problems as they occur and to communicate with non-technical clients in a way they can understand. I have excellent analytical skills and the ability to manage several projects at once while staying focused. I can follow orders and work as a team without any problems but I also have the ability to work alone and still meet tight deadlines.

I hope to hear from you soon to talk about this position and discuss my experience and skills in more detail. Please call (702)498-0327 for an interview.

Respectfully,

Leonardo Prates
