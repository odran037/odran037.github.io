    <p>The whys and the motivations.</p>
      
      <h3>The brain</h3>
      
      <p>I've come to realize that the mind of nearly everyone around me is deteriorating. Much like their bodies wasting away either due to a terrible diet and/or lack of excersize, the brain capabilities are fast diminishing. I don't want that to happen to myself, I try to engage those around me in intelligent conversations and intelligent activities. More often than not my eforts are futile. Since I was a child I wanted to be smart. A genius even if you will. I have not been successull. At becoming a genius that is. But everyday I'm confronted with people who although frustrate me to no end due to their lack of having their braing "on", make me feel like a genius. I, no longer a child, know I won't be a genius and I no longer desire to be one. I am however, determined not to let my mind go to waste. I am eager to learn and spend everyday of my life soaking up as much as possible. I don't limit myself to anything specific. But my heart is in Computer Science and Engineering.<br />I'm not here to convince anyone to eat a balanced diet and get off the couch. I'm not a motivational speaker nor aspire to be one. Everyone knows they need to eat well and exercise. But I believe people are forgetting the importance of exercising their brain. Don't let it go to waste. Strive to learn something new and continue striving.<br />Don't worry, I can assure you, you don't know enough already or too much for that matter. No one can learn "everything". So eat well, exercise and reclaim your brain.</p>
      
      <br />
      
      <p>My goals are to become fluent and proficient at programming and hopefully earn a degree in computer science without putting my self in debt.</p>
      
      <br />
      
      <h3>The body</h3>
      
      <p>This site is not intended for my fitness accomplishments. But like my brain and my educational endeavours, fitness is something very important. Having suffered some injuries dut to an accident, like becoming a genius I won't be able to be as physically fit as I once dreamed.</p>
      
      <br />
      
      <p>My current goals are to reach two miles running. I currently can only run short distances as to not further aggravate my injuries. The second part of the goal is to reach 100 pushups and 100 pullups in one shot. My goals are realistic but will take considerable time.</p>
