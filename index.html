    <p><em>What is this about?</em><br>You probably don't know me. Maybe you do. This site is not advertised in anyway. So you probably stumbled here accidentally. Should you leave? If you want, yes. Will you benefit from staying and reading? That depends on many factors. It's all relative.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm a real person. Though I'm not hell bent on annonimity I am "known" on the interwebs as odran037. If you know or find out my name, I'll have no problem admitting. I've come to peace with the fact that it isn't always convenient or realistic to live a certain way on the web with 100% annonimity. But this is a topic better kept out of this page. The point here is simply to explain why this page even exist, yes?</p>

<hr>

<p>A long time ago(not really) in a galaxy far far away(actually, right here on earth)..<br><em>Warning: this will be filled with dry, desert dry humor. I like the desert.</em></p>

<p>As far as I can remember, I've been a computer guy/nerd/geek?</p>

<h3>So what happened?</h3>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary really.</p>

<p>I've enjoyed this very much for a long time. I always felt like my thing, the thing I was meant to do was computer stuff.</p>

<h3>But something was missing.</h3>

<p>The field of computer science is vast. I never gave much thought to where I wanted to go and to what capacity did I want to be involved with computers.</p>

<p>So I did the only thing I knew how to do. And that was a little bit of everything. With a lot missing in between. Does this mean I'm incompetent? Not proficient enough? Not at all. I feel I've done quite well and have no regrets. Well maybe one.</p>

<h3>The regret</h3>

<p>To put it simply, getting discouraged.</p>

<p><em>Get on with it will ya?</em><br>Ok, ok. Back in AOL days(yes AOL), I remember downloading these cool little "progs" that annoy people deeply but entertained anyone using said proggy. The super uber h4x0rz.<br><br>As childish as that was I, knew there was more to it. There was beauty to lines of code making the computer bend to your will.</p>

<p> I wanted in.</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p>Those uber h4x0r proggys is what really sparked the interest and my dad bought me a C++ book. Turns out Visual Basic was used for the progs. But I pushed on and got nowhere. Either the book just wasn't very good, or my brain power was lacking. I learned how to make an MFC 'Hello, World!' app. It was the least exciting thing I had ever done on a computer. Nothing else made sense even though the book was supposedly geared towards complete beginners. I don't really blame the book. Things just weren't clear enough for me. At that ripe aga of 14, I could do more than everyone else I knew on the computer. But programming was this exotic unreachable art. E-hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>Needless to say I gave up</p> 

<p>Around the same time I had taken an interest in web design and learned the ins and outs of HTML. I tried Javascript and felt the same way I felt with that C++ book. However, I could search the web for Javascript code that did what I wanted and would put it on my website. But I never understood the code. I made my peace with that.</p>

<p>But HTML before CSS was quite boring and there is a point where nothing else could be done.</p>

<p>I then accepted that webdesign and programming just wasn't for me. I then heard someone say, some people get programming. Other don't. That is the worst thing I could have ever heard at that time. I accepted it.</p>

<p>In 2010 I met Python. I Loved every minute I spent reading tutorials and practicing on the interpreter. But I hit a wall again when I didn't know what I could really do with it. I didn't know how to do real world programming. Meaning outside of the interpreter.</p>

<p>I could have gotten discouraged again and given up. But I caught the bug. The programming bug. You know what it is even if you don't have it. When you talk to someone who knows how to code*, look at their eyes, look at the expression on their face and pay attention to their tone. They love it. They are infinitely curious no matter how much they know. Thats what I had become.</p>

<h3>Slowly but surely</h3>

<p>I had the bug. But life gets in the way. Thats my excuse and I'm sticking to it.</p>

<p>It wasn't until a couple of years later that the bug kicked in full gear. I started studying everyday. With no direction, aimlessly trying to devour everything that came my way. It kept things interesting and I learned alot but not enough for lift off. But I couldn't stop</p>

<p>I jumped around different languages, tutorials, books and even tried to find ways to 'learn' better and faster. Thats when I found bootcamp.</p>

<h3>Bootcamp</h3>

<p><em>Lots of pushups?</em><br>My arms are like jelly. Just kidding. Not that kind of bootcamp.</p>

<p>I learned about coding bootcamps. You pay them heaps of money and they plud a cable into the back of your head and upload 4 years worth of computer science directly into your brain in around 3 months, 5 to 6 days per week at least 9 hours per day. This is exactly what I need!</p>

<p>But there is the issue of heaps of money. Boot camps range from $3000 to $20000. The majority costing around $10000. Unfortunately, I don't have that kind of money at my disposal. Things get even worse when one has to consider relocation for 3 months and quitting a job or taking a leave of absense for that amount of time. Suddenly the costs of attending a bootcamp are far higher than just the sticker price.</p>

<p>But I have the bug. The software field is great, with great pay, work-life balance, work satisfaction and etc. But those are but bonuses. I actually really like coding and I want to do it because it makes me happy.</p>

<h3>You've read this far?</h3>

<p>If you've read this far you are either very easily amused or what I wrote was somehow engaging enough. Lets not dwell on it too much.</p>

<p>I guess I still haven't really explained why this page exists. The short answer is Github.</p>

<p>The long answer is, I know programmers use Github but I don't yet have anything to showcase. But I went ahead and created an account. Then I learned about <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and I really like free hosting.</p>

<p>So in the meantime this page will be the home of this text. Until it one day becomes the home of my GitHub portfolio to show potential employers or people I'll collaborate with.</p>
